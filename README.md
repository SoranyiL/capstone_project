Community Helper Hub — Project Overview
    Team Name: HelpHub Heroes
    Submitted by: Rafid, Soranyi

Project Summary
    Community Helper Hub is a responsive web application designed to help individuals in underserved communities quickly locate local resources such as food banks, free clinics, shelters, and other community-based services. Our goal is to bridge the information gap by offering an easy to use app that brings helpful services together in one accessible location.

    The application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a public mapping API to provide a dynamic user experience. We focused heavily on usability, accessibility, and mobile compatibility to ensure it can be used by individuals with limited access to advanced devices.

Problem We Are Solving
    Many people face challenges in finding reliable, local services when they are in need. Whether they’re seeking a free meal, medical care, or safe shelter, navigating city services can be overwhelming, especially for people without strong digital skills or constant internet access.

Community Helper Hub solves this by:

    Centralizing community resources in one location

    Visualizing help nearby via a map

    Allowing users to contribute new, local services

    Making it mobile friendly so it works on any device

User Interface & Design Considerations
    We prioritized a clean and intuitive design, using a calming color palette of blues and grays with green for success indicators. The layout is consistent across pages, and all forms are clearly labeled. Mobile responsiveness was achieved through CSS media queries, and fonts were chosen for readability.

    Interactive elements such as map markers and popups offer users a simple, intuitive way to engage with the platform. The UI avoids clutter and encourages community participation without overwhelming users.

Challenges & Successes

    Learning to integrate Leaflet with JavaScript and manage user-generated map markers

    Ensuring LocalStorage was used effectively to preserve user input

Successes:
